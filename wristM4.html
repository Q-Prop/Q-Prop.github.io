    <h3>Wrist mounted M4 + HPA adapter for Pistol</h3>
    My adaptatrion of a murder box, feeding BBs over a long tube is hard to make reliable so I used a shorter tube. The M4 mag well is mounted on a bracer on my wrist, the attached pistol magazine has an HPA tap.<br>
    This is great when you are gun up and shooting, lots of rounds out of a small package. The problem arrives when you holster the pistol, it's magazine is attached to your arm. I need to add a pistol mag well to the bracer.<br>
