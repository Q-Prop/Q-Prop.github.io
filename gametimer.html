    <h3>Game announcer and Timer</h3>
    Our airsoft field is nearly a kilometer across, it can be hard to tell everyone that a game has started or finished. This box handles teh timing and announcements<br>
    Game duration is set on the front panel, then a wireless remote is used to start the game, which runs until the timer expires or the cancel button is pressed<br>
    There is an in-built siren, and an interface to drive a much louder pole-mounted siren. There is also a radio which is used to send voice announcements of game start and finish to the admin channel.<br>
    You may also notice some cheap radios, they are setup to receive only and fixed to teh admin channel<br>
