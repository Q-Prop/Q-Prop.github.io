    <h3>HPA for GBB Pistol</h3>
    The classic solution mounting an M4 magazine under the grip of a GBB pistol and adding an HPA line. <br>
    I prototyped this with my Ender3 printer but the part did not hold pressure. The final parts are made to order in China, printed in Nylon.<br>
    These two are for a G&G GTP9/SMC9 and a TM spec M9. I tried to do one for a TM MK23, but didn't get the air seal right.<br>
