    <h3>HPA IED</h3>
    A non-descript little box, with an air reservoir, a hundred or so BBS and a remote control. <br>
    The BBs fly around ten meters, although even at point blank they don't hurt you will know it has gone off.<br>
    The air reservoir can be filled through a tyre valve, either with a hand pump, a prtable inflator, or an adapter fitted to an HPA line.<br>
