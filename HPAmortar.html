    <h3>HPA Mortar</h3>
    Firing a 50mm round, this mortar has a range of over 100m. An HPA tank is integrated under the barrel, followed by a lower pressure reservoir at the base of the barrel. Firing uses a modified sprinkler valve.<br>
    The Bipod allows both elevation and traverse adjustment, although I usually don't end up making small corrections.<br>
