<h1>Q-Prop Creations</h1>
This ugly page will eventually get better.<br>
<br>
These are all airsoft props and replicas, used for fun only.<br>
There are no real firearms on this page and none of these items can be converted into or used with real firearms.<br>
I like dressing up as a soldier and playing with toy guns, so do my friends.<br>

<h2>Game Objectives</h2>

<h3>Football</h3>
This was the first prop I built, a multi-purpose "bomb" prop with the usual array of buttons, lights, displays, and siren. There are selectable game modes, each game is a Python script running on the RaspberryPi Zero which is at the core of the Football. As you will see from the interior diagram, this is not a well made or repeatable prop.<br><br>

<h3>Radio Beacon and Direction Finder</h3>
The classic fox hunt, or down pilot game mode. The pilot has an emergency locator beacon, the rescue team have a direction finder with a fairly long range, the enemy have detectors that click like a geiger counter when the beacon is close.<br>
Everything here uses WiFi, the beacon is a WiFi access point an dteh two detectors are simply clients.<br>

<h3>Domination Boxes</h3>
Boxes at strategic objectives spread over the field each have four coloured buttons. Press your team's button to claim the objective, teh more objective your team holds the faster the points accumulate.<br>
The boxes are solar powered with a LiPo battery and a LoRa radio. The Lora setup is a mesh, so each box only needs to be able to reach the next box to communicate.<br>
An additional box operates as the controller, it is not fixed in place and does not have a solar panel so remember to charge it using a USB cable.

<h3>Domination Flags</h3>
As seen at the Airsoft New Zealand nationals competition in 2023, flags raised or lowered to claim each location. <br>
Automated timing and scoring with a siren to announce teh start and end of teh game.<br>

<h3>Juggernaut Clock</h3>
A pair of big LED rings worn on the front and back of a juggernaut player, the rings change colour depending on whether the Jug is active. Red means danger, Jug is shooting. Green means safe, jug isn't shooting.<br>
The front ring is a target, shoot the ring and the Jug will deactivate for 30 seconds. The ring will count that time down, letting you know how much time you have to claim the Jug for your team.

<h3>Juggernaut Noisy Box</h3>
There are times when teh Juggernaut doesn't want to be a target. This box starts by playing cool jazz. Once the Jug is claimed they claiming team press their coloured button and teh box either plays death metal or hard dubstep<br>
If teh music isn't your jam, the box can simply sound the siren every minute to announce teh position of the juggernaut<br>

<h3>Precious Cargo</h3>
Housed in this 30cal amo can is a delicate asset that must be transported to a new location. The box must be held level at all times, tilt it too much for too long and the asset is lost and a siren sounds.<br>
<img src="./PreciousCargo-1.jpg" alt="Precious Cargo Side" width="600"><br>

<h3>Respawn Timer</h3>
Press the big button and watch the respawn time count down. There's a beep at the end if it is too bright to see the display. Internal switches set the respawn time in ten second intervals.
Releasing the button disconnects the battery, so the three AA batteries should last for years of play.

<h3>Medic Timer</h3>
Two buttons, both must be held down on the medic timer, no display but beeps every second for the set time. Internal switches set the respawn time in five second intervals.
Releasing the button disconnects the battery, so the two AAA batteries should last for years of play.

<h3>Game announcer and Timer</h3>
Our airsoft field is nearly a kilometer across, it can be hard to tell everyone that a game has started or finished. This box handles teh timing and announcements<br>
Game duration is set on the front panel, then a wireless remote is used to start the game, which runs until the timer expires or the cancel button is pressed<br>
There is an in-built siren, and an interface to drive a much louder pole-mounted siren. There is also a radio which is used to send voice announcements of game start and finish to the admin channel.<br>
You may also notice some cheap radios, they are setup to receive only and fixed to teh admin channel<br>

<h2>Demolitions</h2>
<h3>Satchel Charge</h3>
A nice large demolition charge is a good way to take out a strategic objective.<br>
<img src="./Satchel-1.jpg" alt="Satchel Charge, top" width="600"><br>

<h3>Sound Grenade</h3>
My third prop was this sound grenade, designed to fit the specific limitations of our field where Pyro and percussive grenades were not permitted. These electronic grenades resemble a Mk2 pineapple grenade, although not enough to get you in trouble with law enforcement. When you pull the pin there is a quick arming beep, followed by a four second delay before the longer detonation beeps. Reinsert the pin and the grenade is ready to go again. <br><br>

<h2>Weapon Accessories</h2>

<h3>Pistol Bayonet</h3>
Bayonets and bayonet charges have fallen out of favour since the invention of the machine gun. So why not put a bayonet on a side arm? Totally ridiculous is one of my favourite ideas. This design uses a Picatinny rail mount and uses the soft rubber blade from a cheap M9 bayonet. The bayonet handle is much shorter, and uncomfortable to hold in your hand. The muzzle loop of the original is now infront of the recoil spring.<br><br>

<h3>HPA for GBB Pistol</h3>
The classic solution ounting an M4 magazine under the grip of a GBB pistol and adding an HPA line. <br>
I prototyped this with my Ender3 printer but the part did not hold pressure. The final parts are made to order in China, printed in Nylon.<br>
These two are for a G&G GTP9/SMC9 and a TM spec M9. I tried to do one for a TM MK23, but didn't get the air seal right.

<h3>M870 to M4 Adapter</h3>
The first time I racked the pump on a friend's Breacher, I knew I had to get one of my own. But the breacher has a pitifully small gas reservoir, so I got the Amped IGL for the Breacher. Did I mention that I like ridiculous weapons for scirmish games? I took my M4 Magwell from the GBB pistol adapter and made an M870 adapter. The first one was vertical, below the standard mag well, but Captain Moose wanted to use his breacher prone. The second model clips onto the top Picatinny rail and uses a feed hose to get into the magwell. I also put Picatinny rail on the top, so my breacher also has a reflex shotgun sight.<br><br>

<h3>Respirator Fan</h3>
A 3D printed fan and battery housing that uses one of the disposable respirator filters as it's base. Forces fresh air into the vision part of the mask to stay fog free.
The fresh air flow into the breating area through the respirator one way valve. <br>

<h3>Wrist mounted M4 + HPA adapter for Pistol</h3>
My adaptatrion of a murder box, feeding BBs over a long tube is hard to make reliable so I used a shorter tube. The M4 mag well is mounted on a bracer on my wrist, the attached pistol magazine has an HPA tap.<br>
This is great when you are gun up and shooting, lots of rounds out of a small package. The problem arrives when you holster the pistol, it's magazine is attached to your arm. I need to add a pistol mag well to the bracer.<br>

<h3>40mm Mortar</h3>
After a lot of experimentation, I have abandonned thi sone. It is great to hang a projectile over the bore of a mortar, then drop it into the bore to fire. Unlike real mortars, airsoft mortars leave a 40mm shell inside the bore, so some sort of removal process is required before firing another round.<br>
Maybe a mortar round containing a CO2 bulb would be a better option.<br>

<h3>40mm Cannon</h3>
A tiny piece of field artilery, it chambers 40mm rounds through a sliding breach. With CO2 powered 40MAX shells, this cannon has a range of over 100m. The CO2 chargers are a source of much pain, proving unreliable even with a lot of maintenance.

<h3>M72 LAW</h3>
Chambered in 40mm, this replica of the M72 LAW opens for fitring, with pop up sights which also pop down when the tube is collapsed.<br>
<img src="./M72-Closed.jpg" alt="M72 LAW closed" width="600"><br>
<img src="./M72LawOpen.jpg" alt="M72 LAW open" width="600"><br>

<h3>HPA Mortar</h3>
Firing a 50mm round, this mortar has a range of over 100m. An HPA tank is integrated under the barrel, followed by a lower pressure reservoir at the base of the barrel. Firing uses a modified sprinkler valve.<br>
The Bipod allows both elevation and traverse adjustment, although I usually don't end up making small corrections.<br>
<img src="./50mmMortar.png" alt="HPA 50mm Mortar" width="600"><br>

<h3>Flame Thrower</h3>
Short range, no hopup and not very reliable, but a BB hose that fires with a ripping sound. Inspired by the Explosive Enterprises team.
