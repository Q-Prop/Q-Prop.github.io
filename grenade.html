    <h3>Sound Grenade</h3>
    My third prop was this sound grenade, designed to fit the specific limitations of our field where Pyro and percussive grenades were not permitted. These electronic grenades resemble a Mk2 pineapple grenade, although not enough to get you in trouble with law enforcement. When you pull the pin there is a quick arming beep, followed by a four second delay before the longer detonation beeps. Reinsert the pin and the grenade is ready to go again. <br>
