    <h3>Juggernaut Noisy Box</h3>
    There are times when teh Juggernaut doesn't want to be a target. This box starts by playing cool jazz. Once the Jug is claimed they claiming team press their coloured button and teh box either plays death metal or hard dubstep<br>
    If teh music isn't your jam, the box can simply sound the siren every minute to announce teh position of the juggernaut<br>
