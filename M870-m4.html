    <h3>M870 to M4 Adapter</h3>
    The first time I racked the pump on a friend's Breacher, I knew I had to get one of my own. But the breacher has a pitifully small gas reservoir, so I got the Amped IGL for the Breacher. Did I mention that I like ridiculous weapons for scirmish games? I took my M4 Magwell from the GBB pistol adapter and made an M870 adapter. The first one was vertical, below the standard mag well, but Captain Moose wanted to use his breacher prone. The second model clips onto the top Picatinny rail and uses a feed hose to get into the magwell. I also put Picatinny rail on the top, so my breacher also has a reflex shotgun sight.<br>
